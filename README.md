In this course, you’ll create your own 2D adventure game. We’ve provided three different asset packs that you can use to customize the game visuals, and there are plenty of opportunities to customize or extend the basic game functionality in small ways too. You’ll also learn about C# scripting as you go — this will be very useful in the future, whether you continue to focus on 2D games or expand into 3D too.
Course structure
This course is organized into six units:
Player character and movement: You’ll set up a player character and configure it to move on a placeholder environment in response to player input.


Game environment and physics: You’ll develop the environment for your game and implement basic physics so the player character can interact with it.


Health system: You’ll create a health system and objects that will increase or decrease the player character’s health on collision.
Heads-up health display: You’ll create a user interface using UI Toolkit, and configure it to reflect the character’s health level.


Characters and interaction mechanics: You’ll create enemies, give a way for the player to neutralize them, and also add a friendly NPC to share a message with the player.


Enhance and polish: You’ll improve the overall experience of the game with dynamic camera, audio, and visual effects. You’ll also have the opportunity to configure your own hand-drawn animations in the game, if you have an art background.
We recommend completing these projects in order, especially if you are a beginner, but if you’re a more confident creator who needs a refresher in one area, then we’ve also created pre-configured scenes that you can use to get started with any of these units independently.
